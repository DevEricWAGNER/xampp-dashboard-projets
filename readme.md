# Dashboard-Projects-Lists

## Description

This project is a web application that allows opening projects in Visual Studio Code from a web browser. It scans a specified directory for projects and displays a card for each project. Clicking on a card opens the corresponding project in Visual Studio Code.

The project consists of several files:

- `index.php`: The main file that displays the list of projects.
- `variables.php`: A file that contains the variables used in the project. **You need to modify this file to match your local setup.**
- `projets.php`: A file that contains the logic for scanning the project directories and displaying the projects.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for the application's style.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for opening the projects in Visual Studio Code.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your terminal.
3. **Modify the `variables.php` file to match your local setup.**
4. Start the local server (if necessary).

## Usage

Open your web browser and navigate to your local server's URL. You should see a list of projects. Click on a project to open it in Visual Studio Code.
